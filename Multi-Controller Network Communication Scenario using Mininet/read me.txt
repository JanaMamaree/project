--> sim-code:
optimal-placement.py: i used the optimal controller placement algorithm for the scalability of the multi-controller network
primary-backup-rep.py: for the consistency
heartbeat.py: for the reliability 
robin-round.py: for load-balancing

--> test-cases:
ocp-test-cases.py: this code evaluates different scenarios for optimizing controller placement in a network.
pbr-test-cases.py: this code simulates failover and data synchronization processes in a primary-backup controller system.
rr-test-cases.py: this script simulates round-robin load balancing in a Mininet network and evaluates its efficiency under different scenarios
